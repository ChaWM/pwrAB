Description: Power analysis for AB testing. The calculations are based on the Welch unequal variances t-test,
  which is generally preferred over the Student t-test when sample sizes and variances of the two groups are
  unequal, which is frequently the case in AB testing. In such situations, the Student t-test will give 
  biased results due to using the pooled standard deviation, unlike the Welch t-test.
