The calculations are based on the Welch t-test, which \n  is generally preferred over the Student t-test when sample sizes and variances of the two groups are\n  unequal, which is frequently the case in AB testing. In such situations, the Student t-test will give \n  biased results, unlike the Welch t-test.\nLicense: GPL (>= 3)\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nURL: http://github.com/williamcha/pwrAB\nBugReports: http://github.com/williamcha/pwrAB/issues\nDepends: R (>= 3.3.1)\nRoxygenNote: 6.0.1\nSuggests: testthat\n",
